# iTerm color scheme conversion tools for Windows

Two simple scripts for converting iTerm color schemes into color schemes for
PuTTY or the Windows console.  Schemes are output in the form of Windows
registry scripts.  For generated PuTTY registry scripts, you must insert the
name of the saved PuTTY session for which the color scheme should be modified.
